# E-Commerce Platform - Redux Store Refactor
This project is a refactor of existing code for an e-commerce platform to use Redux to manage application state.

Given part of a Web developers role is to immerse themselves in a new technology to solve a problem, with only that toolâ€™s documentation for help, this project is intended as a practical run through of this type of experience.

* The app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
* The app's React front end uses a Redux provider to access the store
* The app determines changes to its global state by passing reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
* The app extracts state data from the store using Redux instead of the Context API
* The app dispatches actions using Redux instead of the Context API

## Installation
Ensure you have Node.js installed locally to install packages to and from the public npm registry. Node.js installation documentation.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install application dependencies `npm install`.
